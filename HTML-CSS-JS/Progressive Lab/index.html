                <span class="storybookletter">Y</span>up, that's me. Far right in the image above. <br> Welcome to this little site all about that person there <em>(me)</em>. I swear I'm no narcasist. In fact, this site would never have existed if I had not been forced to make it for a class project in college. Regardless of all that though, here it still sits, and I hope you all enjoy some pretty pictures and maybe a bit of an occasional joke on this site. <strong><br>Thanks, <br>~Patrick R. Conner</strong>
