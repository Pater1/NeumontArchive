                    <p><span class="storybookletter">S</span>tarted by me and a few freinds back in 2013, Undiscovered Game Studios started as a way for us to get away from high school, and actually learn something in a day <em>(shocking idea, I know)</em>! We would pick a thing we wanted to build, build it <em>(with help from Google)</em>, then teach everyone else in the group how we did it. It was awesome! <br>Most of those founding members have moved on now, but, call me nostalgic, I still quite like this brand. I like it so much, I intend to start my own game development studio upon it. The goal is to have it be profitable before I graduate collage, and that is a goal I intend to acheive.</p>

                    <p><span class="storybookletter">V</span>alhalla Fell is the flagship title for Undiscovered Game Studios. The project is ambitious, some may say foolhardy, but I disagree. To my mind, if I can pull this off, everything else coming after making the first game for Undiscovered Game Studios is not just possible, but feasable and resonable. If Valhalla Fell is a success, I know I can be a success in this field too. Nay-say all you like; I'm one stubborn bastard though, good luck!
