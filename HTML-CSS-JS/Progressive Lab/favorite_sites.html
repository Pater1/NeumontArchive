And as anyone with programming experience knows, it is nearly impossible to remember every single command used to interface with the engine. To aliviate this issue, exists this wonderful website to do all the remembering for you <em>(mostly)</em>.

These guys get pretty close! This small group of experienced devs <em>(titularly Raghav and Daniel)</em> have been sharing their knowledge in this field since early 2015. It's good stuff; check it out!

But, maybe you read <em>(heh)</em> the desciption for the above site, and got really excited for all the not-reading stuff involved. If that's the case, I emplore you to check out Extra Credits. Since early 2012, this small group <em>(originally Dan, an animator for Pixar, and James, a many-year experienced game designer.)</em> of passionate game enthusists have been making top-teir videos on the topic of games, their development, and the industry surrounding them. These guys don't just make some of the best content on video games, they make some of the best content of YouTube, <q>Because games matter!</q>
